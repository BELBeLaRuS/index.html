        <h1>Vehicle</h1>

            <p>A vehicle (from Latin vehiculum)<a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle">[1]</a> is a machine designed for self-propulsion, 
                usually to transport people, cargo, or both. Vehicles include wagons, bicycles, 
                motor vehicles (motorcycles, cars, trucks, buses, mobility scooters), railed vehicles (trains, trams), 
                watercraft (ships, boats, underwater vehicles), amphibious vehicles (screw-propelled vehicles, hovercraft), 
                aircraft (airplanes, helicopters, aerostats), and spacecraft.<a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle">[2]</a></p>
             <br>
            <p>Ground vehicles can be broadly classified by the type of contact with the ground: wheels, 
                tracks, rails, or skis. ISO 3833-1977 is the international standard for road vehicle types, 
                terms, and definitions.<a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle">[3]</a></p>
